The general plan I'm thinking is:

1) Use the "alarm clock" functionality of the PaPiRus HAT to boot the raspberry pi every 15 minutes

2) create a DASH script that checks for any attached USB device on startup as
 per : https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/rc-local.md
If there is an attached USB device, the DASH script stops and does nothing else.

If there is not a USB device attached, the DASH script would update the rp.weather repo from github
to get the latest code, then execute the code to pull back the latest weather, and write that to
the epaper HAT along with a time stamp.

If anything fails (Wifi is not available, timeout, whatever), then the script logs the error and proceeds.

At the end of the DASH script, the pi is shutdown.

3) The rp.weather repo will include a python script that pulls from the Dark Sky API (https://darksky.net/dev)
the weather, and pushes that forecast to the epaper along with a timestamp.

Got the base python script working (yah!)

Now, on to getting the bash script working to detect a keyboard on startup etc.
